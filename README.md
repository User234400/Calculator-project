# Calculator Project

## Description

This project is a console-based calculator written in Java, which performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Additionally, it provides functions like power, square root, absolute value, and rounding. The program includes error handling, such as division by zero, and maintains a history of calculations.

## Features

### Basic Arithmetic Operations:
- **Addition**: `x + y`
- **Subtraction**: `x - y`
- **Multiplication**: `x * y`
- **Division**: `x / y` (with division by zero handling)
- **Modulus**: `x % y` (with division by zero handling)

### Additional Functions:
- **Power**: `base^exponent`
- **Square Root**: `sqrt(x)` (with negative number check)
- **Absolute Value**: `abs(x)`
- **Rounding**: `round(x)`

### Additional Features:
- Calculation history is saved during the session.
- Provides a user-friendly text-based menu for selecting operations.
- Automatically outputs the result of each calculation.
- Users can view the history of calculations.
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
